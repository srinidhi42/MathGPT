This is a project built to make Mathematics (the language of gods) (the Queen of the Sciences) more accessible to the People .
LLMs are bad at Math but i hope to train Neural Nets in a better way for it to understand and answer questions in mathematics from basic algebra to more complicated topics like multivariable calculus (a course i am currently taking).
Working on making a possibility for all mathematical works done in course of humanity to be available freely to everyone including published papers.
